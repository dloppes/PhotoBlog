# PhotoBlog
This is my second project from Udemy Course (The Web Developer Bootcamp 2021) where I am developing a photo blog utilising the techniques that I learned in HTML and CSS.


This could be considered a landing page, where by clicking on the images the user would be redirected to another page. At this moment in time, its simply to demonstrate some of the techniques learned in the course so far.

More will be added eventually as the course goes on.
